    "The fundamental constraint in machine learning is the *bias-variance tradeoff*. Roughly speaking, there is no free lunch. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with an example. Suppose we wanted to predict the number of people on the union terrace on a Friday. For 5 Fridays, we send out a team to count the number of people on the terrace (the $y$ variable). We also record the temperature, the price of beer, if it is a home football weekend, the value of the stock market, the number of sailboats on Mendota, and the euro-dollar exchange rate (the $X$ variables).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the data to estimate our model $y=f(X)+\\epsilon$ and use the $X$ data for a 6th Friday to predict the number of people on the terrace, $\\hat{y}$. We then evaluate our estimate by comparing our prediction to the actual number of people on the terrace on the 6th Friday, $(y - \\hat{y})^2$. This is a measure of how well our model works at predicting **out of sample**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose we repeat this experiment $M$ times. We collect $M$ data sets, estimate the model $M$ times, predict the 6th Friday $M$ times. We can form the expected test mse as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{m=1}^M(y_m-\\hat{y}_m)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is straightforward to show that this expression can be decomposed into \n",

    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{m=1}^M(y_m-\\hat{y}_m)^2 & = \\left(E\\left[\\,\\hat{f}(X)\\right]-f(X) \\right)^2 + E\\,\\left(\\,\\hat{f}(X)-E\\left[\\,\\hat{f}(X)\\right]\\right)^2 + \\text{var}(\\epsilon)\\\\\n",
